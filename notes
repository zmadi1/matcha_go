Web api authentication:
1. The client sends login credentials which are validated against a database.
  - if they are valid:
    * A token is generated based on a sample set of data along with a secret key that only the server knows about
2. The token is returned to the client and the client uses this in any future request.
  - When a request contains a JSON Web Token, it is validated using the same secret key that was used to sign in.
